# storeMgr App

## OVERVIEW
StoreMgr App aims to provide small-scale online sellers means to personally store and manage product items and generate a static webpage that they can use to showcase and market their businesses. 

## MOTIVATION
This is a personal project intended for the purpose of learning new programming languages (like ReactJS) and trying out new web technologies(REST API, OAuth, 3rd Party API). It is also my goal to build a software that can be shared with collaborators in the future.

## TARGET AUDIENCE
The target audience would be the small-scale online sellers who might find it beneficial to have the ability to generate their own static webpage that they can use to showcase and market their business. The users of this app would also enjoy the feature that enables them to store and manage the images and details of their product.

This account must be associated with a verified email address and can be linked to various social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter or Instagram).

A ‘Pro’ account which has more flexibility and additional e-commerce features will be implemented in the future.
